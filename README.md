Leveraging Machine Learning to Classify Junk Food vs. Regular Food

The U.S. food supply is heavily dominated by packaged foods and beverages, which contribute
approximately 75% of daily calorie intake for the population. A significant portion of these
calories derives from foods commonly perceived as “junk foods.” However, there is no
universally accepted definition of junk food in academic literature, making it challenging to
standardize classification. Many products high in saturated fat, added sugars, energy, or salt are
not consistently labeled as junk food. The overconsumption of such foods has been linked to
serious health issues, including heart disease, obesity, and reduced overall functionality.
This project aims to explore machine learning approaches to classify foods into two categories:
"junk food" and "regular food." By leveraging nutritional data and advanced computational
techniques, we will provide a systematic framework to analyze and categorize foods. This
initiative aligns with growing efforts to address public health challenges through data-driven
insights.
